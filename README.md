# NWBinaryHeap
An Objective-C binary heap implementation using a binary tree

## Complexity
Insert and extract operations operate in `log(n)` time where n is the number of elements in the heap.
Examine operates in constant time.

## Future plans
* Rename some of the methods
* Change the way keys are compared
  * Thinking of using NSSortDescriptor
* Removing the key property and just sort inserted objects
